# dart_wot

dart_wot is an implementation of the
Web of Things [Scripting API](https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/) modelled
after the WoT reference implementation
[node-wot](https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/node-wot).
At the moment, it supports interacting with Things using the Constrained Application
Protocol (CoAP), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the MQTT protocol.

## Features

You can consume Thing Descriptions and interact with a Thing based on its
exposed Properties, Actions, and Events.
Discovery support is currently limited to the "direct" method (i.e. fetching a
TD using a single URL).
Exposing Things is not yet supported but will be added in future versions.

Using the Protocol Interfaces in the `core` package, you can add support for
additional protocols in your own application or library. The main requirement
for this to work is the existence of a URI scheme for the given protocol.

## Getting started

To get started, you first need to install the package by adding it to your
`pubspec.yaml` file.
You can use `dart pub add dart_wot` (for a Dart project) or
`flutter pub add dart_wot` (for a Flutter project) to do so.

You can then use the package in your project by adding
`import 'package:dart_wot/dart_wot.dart'` to your source files.

## Usage

Below you can find a very basic example for reading a status from a Thing (using the
`coap.me` test server).
To do so, a Thing Description JSON string is first parsed and turned into a
`ThingDescription` object, which is then passed to a WoT runtime created by a
`Servient` with CoAP support.

```dart
import 'package:dart_wot/dart_wot.dart';

Future<void> main(List<String> args) async {
  final CoapClientFactory coapClientFactory = CoapClientFactory(null);
  final servient = Servient()..addClientFactory(coapClientFactory);
  final wot = await servient.start();

  final thingDescriptionJson = '''
  {
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/td",
    "title": "Test Thing",
    "base": "coap://coap.me",
    "security": ["nosec_sc"],
    "securityDefinitions": {
      "nosec_sc": {
        "scheme": "nosec"
      }
    },
    "properties": {
      "status": {
        "forms": [
          {
            "href": "/hello"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ''';

  final thingDescription = ThingDescription(thingDescriptionJson);
  final consumedThing = await wot.consume(thingDescription);
  final status = await consumedThing.readProperty("status");
  final value = await status.value();
  print(value);
}
```

A more complex example can be found in the `example` directory.

## Additional information

The package will be extended gradually over the upcoming months.
Support for exposing Things will be added as well as
more protocols and security schemes.
