# dart_wot: A W3C Web of Things implementation written in Dart

dart_wot is an implementation of the
Web of Things [Scripting API](https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/) modelled
after the  WoT reference implementation
[node-wot](https://github.com/eclipse/thingweb.node-wot).
It is supposed to support CoAP and HTTP as its first implementation milestones.
The API, however, should allow for a relatively easy expansion to other protocols
in the future.
